- title: "Distance-wise Prototypical Graph Neural Network for Imbalanced Node Classification"
  image: dpgnn.png
  description: Recent years have witnessed the significant success of applying graph neural networks (GNNs) in learning effective node representations for classification. However, current GNNs are mostly built under the balanced data-splitting, which is inconsistent with many real-world networks where the number of training nodes can be extremely imbalanced among the classes. Thus, directly utilizing current GNNs on imbalanced data would generate coarse representations of nodes in minority classes and ultimately compromise the classification performance. This therefore portends the importance of developing effective GNNs for handling imbalanced graph data. In this work, we propose a novel Distance-wise Prototypical Graph Neural Network (DPGNN), which proposes a class prototype-driven training to balance the training loss between majority and minority classes and then leverages distance metric learning to differentiate the contributions of different dimensions of representations and fully encode the relative position of each node to each class prototype. Moreover, we design a new imbalanced label propagation mechanism to derive extra supervision from unlabeled nodes and employ self-supervised learning to smooth representations of adjacent nodes while separating inter-class prototypes. Comprehensive node classification experiments and parameter analysis on multiple networks are conducted and the proposed DPGNN almost always significantly outperforms all other baselines, which demonstrates its effectiveness in imbalanced node classification.

- title: "Tree Decomposed Graph Neural Network"
  image: treedecompose.png
  description: Iterative propagation restricts the information of higher-layer neighborhoods to being transported through and first fused with the lower-layer neighborhoods', which unavoidably results in feature smoothing between neighborhoods in different layers and can thus compromise the performance. Furthermore, most deep GNNs only recognize the importance of incorporating higher-layer neighborhoods while yet to fully explore the importance of multi-hop dependency within the context of different layer neighborhoods in learning better representations. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the feature smoothing between neighborhoods in different layers and empirically demonstrate the variance of the homophily level across neighborhoods at different layers. Then, motivated by these analyses, we propose a tree decomposition method to disentangle neighborhoods in different layers to help alleviate feature smoothing among these layers. Moreover, we capture and maintain the importance of multi-hop dependency via graph diffusion within our tree decomposition formulation to construct Tree Decomposed Graph Neural Network (TDGNN), which can flexibly incorporate information from large receptive fields and utilizing the multi-hop dependency.

- title: "Graph Neural Networks: Self-supervised Learning"
  image: gnnssl.png
  description: Although deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous domains, these models generally require large annotated datasets to reach their full potential and avoid overfitting. However, obtaining such datasets can have high associated costs or even be impossible to procure. Self-supervised learning (SSL) seeks to create and utilize specific pretext tasks on unlabeled data to aid in alleviating this fundamental limitation of deep learning models. Although initially applied in the image and text domains, recent interest has been in leveraging SSL in the graph domain to improve the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs). For node-level tasks, GNNs can inherently incorporate unlabeled node data through the neighborhood aggregation unlike in the image or text domains; but they can still benefit by applying novel pretext tasks to encode richer information and numerous such methods have recently been developed. For GNNs solving graph-level tasks, applying SSL methods is more aligned with other traditional domains, but still presents unique challenges and has been the focus of a few works. In this chapter, we summarize recent developments in applying SSL to GNNs categorizing them via the different training strategies and types of data used to construct their pretext tasks, and finally discuss open challenges for future directions.

- title: "A Data-Integration Analysis on Road Emissions and Traffic Patterns"
  image: PopularStreet.png
  description: Understanding human activities and urban mobility patterns is key to solving many urban issues such as congestion and emissions. With the abundant data sets available at different levels of fidelity, one of the main challenges is the sparsity and heterogeneity of data sources. The integration of such data sources is essential to better inform system design and community-level strategies. In this paper, we incorporate a variety of data sources including land use, vehicle emissions and building footprint to comprehensively visualize and analyze traffic patterns in the Chicago Loop area. We first implement and compare three different nearest-neighbor-search algorithms to determine building occupancy assignment, and then perform a spatial-temporal correlation analysis of vehicle emissions focusing on factors such as land use, public transit and demographic. Lastly, we discuss the traffic characteristics from data analysis, such as traffic congestion formation and rush hours etc.
