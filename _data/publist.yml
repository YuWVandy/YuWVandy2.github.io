  description: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in learning better representations by performing feature propagation and transformation iteratively to leverage neighborhood information. Nevertheless, iterative propagation restricts the information of higher-layer neighborhoods to being transported through and first fused with the lower-layer neighborhoods', which unavoidably results in feature smoothing between neighborhoods in different layers and can thus compromise the performance, %leads to poor performance, 
especially on heterophily networks. Furthermore, most deep GNNs only recognize the importance of incorporating higher-layer neighborhoods while yet to fully explore the importance of multi-hop dependency within the context of different layer neighborhoods in learning better representations. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the feature smoothing between neighborhoods in different layers and empirically demonstrate the variance of the homophily level across neighborhoods at different layers. Then, motivated by these analyses, we propose a tree decomposition method to disentangle neighborhoods in different layers to help alleviate feature smoothing among these layers. Moreover, we capture and maintain the importance of multi-hop dependency via graph diffusion within our tree decomposition formulation to construct Tree Decomposed Graph Neural Network (TDGNN), which can flexibly incorporate information from large receptive fields and utilizing the multi-hop dependency. Comprehensive experiments and parameter analysis on citation, webpage, and actor co-occurrence networks demonstrate that TDGNN primarily achieves superior performance on both homophily and heterophily networks under a variety of node classification settings while also showing its ability to prevent over-smoothing and effectiveness in only utilizing features from shallow layers while leveraging deeper multi-hop dependencies, which provides new insights towards deeper graph neural networks.
