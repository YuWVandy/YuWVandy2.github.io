  description: Iterative propagation restricts the information of higher-layer neighborhoods to being transported through and first fused with the lower-layer neighborhoods', which unavoidably results in feature smoothing between neighborhoods in different layers and can thus compromise the performance. Furthermore, most deep GNNs only recognize the importance of incorporating higher-layer neighborhoods while yet to fully explore the importance of multi-hop dependency within the context of different layer neighborhoods in learning better representations. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the feature smoothing between neighborhoods in different layers and empirically demonstrate the variance of the homophily level across neighborhoods at different layers. Then, motivated by these analyses, we propose a tree decomposition method to disentangle neighborhoods in different layers to help alleviate feature smoothing among these layers. Moreover, we capture and maintain the importance of multi-hop dependency via graph diffusion within our tree decomposition formulation to construct Tree Decomposed Graph Neural Network (TDGNN), which can flexibly incorporate information from large receptive fields and utilizing the multi-hop dependency.

- title: "A Data-Integration Analysis on Road Emissions and Traffic Patterns"

  description: Understanding human activities and urban mobility patterns is key to solving many urban issues such as congestion and emissions. With the abundant data sets available at different levels of fidelity, one of the main challenges is the sparsity and heterogeneity of data sources. The integration of such data sources is essential to better inform system design and community-level strategies. In this paper, we incorporate a variety of data sources including land use, vehicle emissions and building footprint to comprehensively visualize and analyze traffic patterns in the Chicago Loop area. We first implement and compare three different nearest-neighbor-search algorithms to determine building occupancy assignment, and then perform a spatial-temporal correlation analysis of vehicle emissions focusing on factors such as land use, public transit and demographic. Lastly, we discuss the traffic characteristics from data analysis, such as traffic congestion formation and rush hours etc.
