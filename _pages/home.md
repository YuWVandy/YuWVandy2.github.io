I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/eecs/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://vanderbilt.edu) advised by [Dr. Tyler Derr](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~derrtyle/).

My research interest lies in the domains of applied-machine learning and data mining on graphs with an emphasis on deep learning on graphs. More specifically, I am currently researching graph neural networks (GNNs) focusing on ways to leverage high-order attention and neighorhood information to tackle the over-smoothing and over-squashing problem in deep graph neural network models, which imposes significant impact on learning better representations for tasks such as node classification, link prediction and community detection. Meanwhile, I am highly interested in applying various self-supervised learning strategies including contrastive learning to further boost the performance of GNNs..
