I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/eecs/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://vanderbilt.edu) advised by [Dr. Tyler Derr](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~derrtyle/).

My research interest lies in graph data mining with an emphasis on deep learning. More specifically, I am currently researching graph neural networks (GNNs) focusing on ways to leverage high-order attention and neighorhood information to tackle the over-smoothing and over-squashing problem in deep graph neural network models. Meanwhile, I am highly interested in applying various self-supervised learning strategies including contrastive learning and scalable graph neural networks.
